## Welcome

I am a conservation biologist exploring new opportunities to use technology to protect and monitor wildlife and wild places. My interests include human-wildlife interactions, anti-poaching, elephant behavioral ecology, and remote communication technologies. 

I am currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow with Dr. George Wittemyer in the department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology at Colorado State University. I also serve as a Conservation Technology Consultant with the [Biodiversity and Wildlife Solutions Program at RESOLVE](resolv.org/site-BiodiversityWildlifeSolutions/).
