## Welcome

I am a conservation biologist exploring new opportunities to use technology to protect and monitor wildlife and wild places. My interests include human-wildlife interactions, anti-poaching, elephant behavioral ecology, and remote communication technologies. 

I am currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow with Dr. George Wittemyer in the department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology at Colorado State University. I also serve as a Conservation Technology Consultant with the [Biodiversity and Wildlife Solutions Program at RESOLVE](resolv.org/site-BiodiversityWildlifeSolutions/).

### Research Interests
My interests are driven by problems with no clear solutions. 

The world’s megafauna, especially in Africa, are undergoing a rapid loss of habitat and increasing pressures from poaching and bushmeat hunting, and those charged with protecting these wild places face steep odds to combat these pressures. From 2007 to 2014, between 25,000 and 35,000 elephants were killed each year for their ivory, or in more stark terms, one elephant killed every 15 minutes. The pressure on other species, such as rhinos and pangolins, is even more intense. Managers face a number of challenges in managing parks; reserves established to protect endangered megafauna are often vast, ranger patrols are spread thin and it can be difficult to gather intelligence data, and communications are poor or non-existent. As population densities continue to increase along the boarders of reservers, conflict between humans and wildlife have also increased, which can lead to injury or even death of people and animals. These compounding problems leave little capacity to protect vanishing species, which presents an important question that drives my research: 

How can we create affordable and efficient force multipliers that work in tandem with rangers and communities to protect wildlife and people in harsh field conditions? 

My research is focused on three main categories: 
- Assessing technologies for anti-poaching and human-elephant conflict 
- Investigating elephant movement behavior and feeding to inform landscape planning in the Mara-Serengeti Ecosystem
- Researching drivers of conservation success and failure, in the context of both technology and park management

To persue these questions, I work with engineers and researchers to build new technologies and test thier performance in the field. Equally important, I am interested in finding fresh ways to sustainably deploy and scale new devices in a conservation setting, where the drivers to keep prices low and maintain developer support are often non-existant.  

I also work with community-based projects to increase local participation in conservation and bring increased benefits to people living with wildlife. There is a large potential for low-cost and easily scalable technologies to help connect underserved populations and engage them in conservation, and I am interested in exploring these opportunities with developers and groups working on the ground.
