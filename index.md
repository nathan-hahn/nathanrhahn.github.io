## Welcome

I am a conservation biologist exploring new opportunities to use technology to protect and monitor wildlife and wild places. My interests include human-wildlife interactions, anti-poaching, elephant behavioral ecology, and remote communication technologies. 

I am currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow with Dr. George Wittemyer in the department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology at Colorado State University. I also serve as a Conservation Technology Consultant with the [Biodiversity and Wildlife Solutions Program at RESOLVE](resolv.org/site-BiodiversityWildlifeSolutions/). 

### Research Interests
I am interested in investigating the use of technologies to protect and study wildlife. I work with engineers and researchers to build new technologies, test performance in the field, and find sustainable ways to deploy and scale new devices. 

My current research is broad, but I am currently focused on three main categories: 
- Assessing technologies for anti-poaching and human-elephant conflict 
- Investigating elephant movement behavior and feeding to inform landscape planning in the Mara-Serengeti Ecosystem
- Researching drivers of conservation success and failure, in the context of both technology and park management

I also work with community-based projects to increase local participation in conservation and bring increased benefits to people living with wildlife. There is a large potential for low-cost and easily scalable technologies to help connect underserved populations and engage them in conservation, and I am interested in exploring these opportunities with developers and groups working on the ground.
